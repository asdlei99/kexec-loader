Version 1.6.2:
	Fixed a bug: specifying filesystem type AND /dev/ for a non-existant
	device no longer attempts to free an invalid address.

Version 1.6.1:
	Fixed a bug: config_parse() silently ignored initrd due to a typo.
	
	Added reboot, halt and cat commands to shell.
	
	Implemented autocompletion for commands and filenames in the shell.
	
	Fixed a bug: pressing a key to stop searching for boot disk no longer
	results in an infinite loop.
	
	Changed behaviour of kexec_config kernel option, it now forces the boot
	device instead of just adding it to the top of the search list.

Version 1.6:
	Replaced unsafe mmap() code in detect_fstype() which crashed on small
	partitions, such as MS-DOS extended.
	
	Upgraded kexec-tools to version 2.0.0
	
	Fixed a bug: console_getsize() returned 0x0 on serial consoles, it now
	defaults to 80x24 if the ioctl() call returns 0x0.
	
	Rewrote shell input code to support decent line editing.
	
	Updated shell history code to not log empty lines, or repeat commands.
	
	Rewrote command parsing code to be more like that of a normal shell,
	the new parser stores arguments in argv[] and sets argc.
	
	Added basic shell commands (cd, ls, find, etc...)
	
	Changed module loading behaviour: All files in /modules/ named *.ko are
	loaded automatically, options may be set in /modules/modules.conf

Version 1.5:
	Rewrote code which finds the boot disk.
	
	Removed capability to reload configuration by pressing R at the main
	menu.
	
	Added support for loading Linux modules and inserting them into the
	kernel, gzip compressed modules are also supported.
	
	Fixed a bug: nptr->mpoint was not set to the return value of
	str_append() in config_add_mount(), which could cause a segfault
	depending on state of OS memory management code.
	
	Updated styling of status messages to make them more consistant.
	
	Rewrote detect_fstype() to use mmap() instead of reading MAGIC_BUF_SIZE
	bytes of into stack memory.
	
	Updated mount code to create device nodes from /proc/diskstats and
	removed hdx/sdx mknod code from mkinitramfs.sh

Version 1.4.3:
	Fixed bug caused by my stupidity and lack of testing:
		grub_loadcfg() incorrectly checked that grub_root was set, why
		does this seem so familiar? Oh yeah! Version 1.3.1!

Version 1.4.2:
	Replaced malloc() calls with allocate() calls for simplicity.
	
	Replaced most fixed-length strings with dynamic strings in order to
	save memory.
	
	Replaced kl_target.modules array with a linked-list to remove the limit
	on multiboot modules.
	
	Added multiboot module support for GRUB configuration files.

Version 1.4.1:
	Added support for ISO-9660 to detect_fstype().
	
	Added command history, scrolls through previous commands on up/down
	arrow keys, by default the history size is 32 commands.
	
	Added nano-like scrolling for editing commands which are longer then
	the screen, otherwise backspacing before column 1 deletes characters
	from the command buffer, but not from the screen.
	
	Added module command and configuration directive to support loading
	multiboot modules.

Version 1.4:
	Added cmdline configuration directive.
	
	Updated load_kernel() to take a kl_target as its argument and store the
	argument strings in dynamic memory.
	
	Removed STACK_BUF macro and replaced it with fixed buffers of smaller
	sizes since 2048 is overkill for any of them.
	
	Fixed a bug: unmount_list() now returns if mounts = NULL instead of
	getting stuck in an infinite loop.
	
	Wrote shell for interactively configuring and booting targets, will be
	improved a lot over the next versions.
	
	Added reset-vga directive/command which passes kexec the --reset-vga
	argument when loading the kernel.
	
	Updated the kexec-tools merge patch to make die() output error messages
	in the same style as kexec-loader.
	
	Implemented free_targets(), fixed a memory leak in config_load() and
	used value2 in config_parse() to get rid of a warning.

Version 1.3.1:
	Updated makefile structure and added new targets.
	
	Updated run_kexec() to directly call kexec_main() in the child process
	instead of calling itself with argv[0]="kexec" via execv().
	
	Fixed bug: grub_loadcfg() now checks that grub_root is set before
	attempting to mount it, how the hell did I overlook this?!
	
	Fixed bug: load_menu() now correctly handles the 'default' directive
	in menu.lst.

Version 1.3:
	Created mount_dev() function to cut down on duplicate mounting code.
	
	Added support for reading GRUB menu.lst and device.map files.

Version 1.2:
	Rewrote fatal() function and removed pointless calls to it.
	
	Fixed bug: main_menu() no longer crashes if you have zero targets.
	
	Fixed bug: Timeout is no longer displayed after a one second delay.
	
	Rewrote a lot of code used for loading configuration.
	
	Removed obsolete mount_add(), mount_copy(), mount_free(), target_add()
	and target_free() functions.
	
	Added STACK_LIMIT and STACK_BUF macros which configure the maximum
	stack size and the size of auto buffers.
	
	Wrote check_device() function for checking that devices exist before
	attempting to mount, determine FS type, etc.
	
	Updated config_add_mount() to prepend /mnt/ to kl_mount.mpoint so that
	an extra buffer isn't required in mount_list() or unmount_list().
	
	Updated config_mount() to retry finding the configuration disk upto 3
	times upon failure with delay increasing with each attempt.
	
	Optimised some of the screen drawing code to not write pointless
	characters to the console.
	
	Implemented new console output API: printm(), printM(), printd() and
	printD() which are macro wrappers around print2().
	
	Improved status messages displayed while loading a target.
	
	Updated list_devices() to display the filesystem type of all devices
	found in /proc/diskstats.
	
	Updated build system to download and patch kexec-tools then build the
	kexec program into kexec-loader like busybox to save space.
	
	Removed HOST and CC variables from root Makefile and added ifdef to set
	the CC and configure options as required if a HOST variable is passed
	in the environment.
	
	Updated mount_config() to check for the kernel option kexec_config and
	insert the supplied device at the start of the devices list.
	
	Updated mount_config() to detect the filesystem type using
	detect_fstype() instead of using the hardcoded BOOTFS_TYPE macro.

Version 1.1:
	Removed directives for creating devices, all devices inodes should be
	included with the initramfs.
	
	Redesigned mkinitramfs.sh to create a CPIO archive and to use fakeroot
	if the script is not being run as root.
	
	Updated configuration file parser.
	
	Added seperate debug console and /proc/kmsg monitor.
	
	Rewrote code which deals with mounting/unmounting the disk containing
	CONFIG_FILE.
	
	Rewrote mount_list() to be more effecient by ordering the mounts in
	order of depth.
	
	Replaced unmount_tree() function with unmount_list().
	
	Added support for detecting ext2, ext3, XFS, ReiserFS, minix, FAT and
	NTFS filesystem types.
	
	Rewrote menu code, it's slightly more sane now.
	
	Implemented list_devices() function, pressing L at the menu displays
	a list of all devices listed in /proc/diskstats.

Version 1.0:
	Initial release.
