Version 1.2:
	Rewrote fatal() function and removed pointless calls to it.
	
	Fixed bug: main_menu() no longer crashes if you have zero targets.
	
	Fixed bug: Timeout is no longer displayed after a one second delay.
	
	Rewrote a lot of code used for loading configuration.
	
	Removed obsolete mount_add(), mount_copy(), mount_free(), target_add()
	and target_free() functions.
	
	Added STACK_LIMIT and STACK_BUF macros which configure the maximum
	stack size and the size of auto buffers.
	
	Wrote check_device() function for checking that devices exist before
	attempting to mount, determine FS type, etc.
	
	Updated config_add_mount() to prepend /mnt/ to kl_mount.mpoint so that
	an extra buffer isn't required in mount_list() or unmount_list().
	
	Updated config_mount() to retry finding the configuration disk upto 3
	times upon failure with delay increasing with each attempt.
	
	Optimised some of the screen drawing code to not write pointless
	characters to the console.
	
	Implemented new console output API: printm(), printM(), printd() and
	printD() which are macro wrappers around print2().
	
	Improved status messages displayed while loading a target.
	
	Updated list_devices() to display the filesystem type of all devices
	found in /proc/diskstats.
	
	Updated build system to download and patch kexec-tools then build the
	kexec program into kexec-loader like busybox to save space.
	
	Removed HOST and CC variables from root Makefile and added ifdef to set
	the CC and configure options as required if a HOST variable is passed
	in the environment.
	
	Updated mount_config() to check for the kernel option kexec_config and
	insert the supplied device at the start of the devices list.
	
	Updated mount_config() to detect the filesystem type using
	detect_fstype() instead of using the hardcoded BOOTFS_TYPE macro.

Version 1.1:
	Removed directives for creating devices, all devices inodes should be
	included with the initramfs.
	
	Redesigned mkinitramfs.sh to create a CPIO archive and to use fakeroot
	if the script is not being run as root.
	
	Updated configuration file parser.
	
	Added seperate debug console and /proc/kmsg monitor.
	
	Rewrote code which deals with mounting/unmounting the disk containing
	CONFIG_FILE.
	
	Rewrote mount_list() to be more effecient by ordering the mounts in
	order of depth.
	
	Replaced unmount_tree() function with unmount_list().
	
	Added support for detecting ext2, ext3, XFS, ReiserFS, minix, FAT and
	NTFS filesystem types.
	
	Rewrote menu code, it's slightly more sane now.
	
	Implemented list_devices() function, pressing L at the menu displays
	a list of all devices listed in /proc/diskstats.

Version 1.0:
	Initial release.
