version 1.2:
	Write script to create floppy images
	
	Create patch to allow /sbin/kexec to be included in the kexec-loader
	program (Maybe busybox style?)
	
	Write script to download, patch and merge kexec-tools with the
	kexec-loader sources.

Maybe:
	Implement a shell like GRUB has?
	
	Support for reopening the menu?
	
	Load config file from /dev/hdx?
