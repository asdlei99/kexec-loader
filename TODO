Version 1.4:
	Support for running kexec-loader at the end of a system reboot in
	order to load a new kernel without rebooting the hardware.

Future/maybe:
	Console for configuring and booting targets on the fly, like GRUB?
	
	Improve the kexec-tools merge patch to allow kexec to be run inside the
	main process and to use the kexec-loader console I/O functions?
