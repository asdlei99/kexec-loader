Version 1.2:
	Write script to create floppy images

Version 1.3:
	Support reading GRUB configuration files.

Future/maybe:
	Console for configuring and booting targets on the fly, like GRUB?
	
	Support for running kexec-loader at the end of a system reboot in
	order to load a new kernel without rebooting the hardware?
